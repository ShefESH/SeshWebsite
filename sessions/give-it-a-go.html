    <p>Do you want to learn how web applications can be exploited and protected?</p>

    <p>As more and more people move online there is a growing number of websites that have poor implementations of security, meaning that unauthorised parties can exploit the application. We aim to show off some of the most common vulnerabilities that can be in web applications, so that you are aware of them and can avoid them in your own applications.</p>

    <p>OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/">Juice Shop</a> is an intentionally vulnerable web application that shows off multiple common and advanced exploits that can appear in web applications. Juice shop gamifies exploiting the vulnerabilities by giving challenges to complete that range from easy to hard to complete. Learn how the vulnerabilities exist and how to exploit them yourself.</p>

    <p>There will be a follow up session that you can attend that will contain a more advanced walkthrough. This will be on the 12th October 2020, and will require you to be a member of the society, so <a href="https://su.sheffield.ac.uk/activities/view/ethical-student-hackers-society">buy a membership</a> quick!</p>

    <p>Get your tickets for FREE and we will send you a link via email to join our session on Blackboard Collaborate!</p>
