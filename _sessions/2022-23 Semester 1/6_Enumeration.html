This week's session will be on Enumeration - the first and most important step in a penetration test.
We'll teach you about some of the most common tools and services, and how to squeeze as much information from them as possible.
This session will be very interactive and will require some problem solving! We will be poking at several machines on Hack the Box, which is an online penetration testing platform. It requires a bit of setup with the links provided.
Please don't be daunted by the setup - we will still aim to make these sessions as accessible as possible, which is why we are also providing alternative web-based activities. But if you can setup Kali or similar, please do. We are currently looking into booking computer rooms for sessions, but have been unable to do so so far - we'll let you know if this is possible.
There is also an EGM this week which will take place for the final half hour.
