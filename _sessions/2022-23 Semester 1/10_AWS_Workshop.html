AWS (Amazon Web Services) provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals and companies. Learning how to utilise them (and cloud services in general) is extremely beneficial both for your career and personal development.
We will cover S3, static pages with S3, EC2, how to host a website on EC2 and how to do all this securely.
