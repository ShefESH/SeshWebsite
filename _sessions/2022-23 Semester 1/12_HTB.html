We will be doing a Hack the Box machine (RedPanda) which is still available on free tier HacktheBox but has retired. You'll need an account at https://www.hackthebox.com/. This is a great session for practicing and recapping all the skills from this semester, and will ship with slides summarising everything we've done so far
