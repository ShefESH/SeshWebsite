<h3>We are SESH, the University of Sheffield's Ethical Student Hackers Society</h3>

<p>We deliver regular sessions covering a variety of cybersecurity topics - right from the theory, to applying it to ethical hacking!</p>
<p>We formed in 2018, and for the 2020-21 academic year our committee hopes to continue improving our sessions and open them up to more beginners in this challenging and exciting field!</p>
<p>All of our committee have a keen interest Cybersecurity, and a wide range of experiences and knowledge that we're excited to share with you - from web design to hardware!</p>

<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>

<p>Before you dive in, make sure you read our <a href="{{ site.url }}/downloads/SESH Code of Conduct.pdf">Code of Conduct</a> - if you come to any of our sessions you'll have to follow it, and it's important to make sure you work within the law when practising your Cybersecurity skills</p>

<div class="separator"><h2>What We Do</h2></div>

<h3>Cybersecurity Fundamentals</h3>

<p>From the basics of Linux to the nitty gritty of networking, we'll teach you everything you need to know to get started in Cybersecurity</p>

<p>We know how daunting it can be to start off in such a complicated field - that's why we'll also provide you with useful resources, such as cheatsheets and places to practice, available on our wiki</p>

<h3>Cybersecurity Tools</h3>

<p>We'll take you through how to use some of the most common tools in Cybersecurity - <a href="https://nmap.org/">nmap</a>, <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp">Burp Suite</a>, and more!</p>

<p>We'll also teach you how to build your own tools, using common languages like python for automating tasks, enumerating websites and networks, and even cracking passwords</p>

<h3>Ethical Hacking</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most exciting and varied area of Cybersecurity, ethical hacking (or penetration testing) is a challenging, fun and rewarding way to test your skills - and it can lead to a lucrative career!</p>

<p>We'll teach you the tools and techniques you'll need, the theory behind what you're doing, and methodologies such as enumeration and privelege escalation</p>

<p>Then we'll let you practice your new skills with challenges, Capture the Flag events, and walkthroughs of boxes on platforms like Hack the Box, VulnHub, and TryHackMe</p>
