<h3>We are SESH, the University of Sheffield's Ethical Student Hackers Society</h3>

<p>We deliver regular sessions covering a variety of cybersecurity topics - right from the theory, to applying it to ethical hacking!</p>
<p>We formed in 2018, and for the 2020-21 academic year our committee hopes to continue improving our sessions and open them up to more beginners in this challenging and exciting field!</p>
<p>All of our committee have a keen interest in the field, and a wide range of experiences and knowledge that we're excited to share with you - from web design to hardware!</p>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>Before you dive in, make sure you read our <a href="{{ site.url }}/downloads/SESH Code of Conduct.pdf">Code of Conduct</a> - if you come to any of our sessions you'll have to follow it, and it's important to make sure you work within the law when practising your Cybersecurity skills</p>

<h2>What we Do</h2>

<h3>Cybersecurity Fundamentals</h3>

<p>From the basics of linux to the nitty gritty of networking, we'll teach you everything you need to know to get started in Cybersecurity</p>

<p>We know how daunting it can be to start off in such a complicated field - that's why we'll also provide you with useful resources, such as cheatsheets and places to practice, available on our wiki</p>

<h3>Cybersecurity Tools</h3>

<p>We'll take you through how to use some of the most common tools in Cybersecurity - nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite, and more!</p>

<p>We'll also teach you how to build your own tools, using common languages like python</p>

<h3>Ethical Hacking</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most exciting and varied area of Cybersecurity, Ethical Hacking (or Penetration Testing) is a challenging and fun way to test your skills - and it can lead to a lucrative career!</p>

<p>We'll teach you the tools and techniques you'll need, the theory behind what you're doing, and methodologies such as enumeration and privelege escalation</p>

<p>Then we'll let you practice your new skills, with challenges, Capture the Flag events, and walkthroughs of boxes on platforms like Hack the Box, VulnHub, and TryHackMe</p>
