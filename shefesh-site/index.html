<h3>We are the SESH, Sheffield's Ethical Student Hacking Society</h3>

<p>We deliver regular sessions covering a variety of cybersecurity topics - right from the theory, to applying it to ethical hacking!</p>
<p>We formed in 2018, and for the 2020-21 academic year our committee hopes to continue improving our sessions and open them up to more beginners in this challenging and exciting field!</p>
