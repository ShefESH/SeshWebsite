                <strong>We deliver regular sessions covering a variety of cybersecurity topics</strong>
                <p>We'll teach you all the theory, including <span class="blue">web application attacks</span> and <span class="blue">buffer overflows</span>.</p>
                <p>And we'll go from the theory to applying it to <span class="blue">ethical hacking!</span></p>

    <div class="content-wrapper" style="padding-bottom: 0;">
        <p>We have a diverse society and anyone from the University of Sheffield is welcome! You can be confident that members of any ability are welcome to join - we want to provide something for everyone, no matter your experience.</p>

        <p>For non-University of Sheffield students, you can still access a number of free resources on our <a href="/wiki">wiki</a>, and potentially even participate in joint events or CTFs in the future.</p>

        <p>All of our committee have a keen interest Cybersecurity, and a wide range of experiences and knowledge that we're excited to share with you - from web design to hardware! Meet our committee <a href="/committee">here!</a></p>

        <p>Anyone is welcome to join committee, regardless of their background - if you want to join, <a href="/contact">contact us!</a></p>

    <div class="separator"><h2>What You'll Learn</h2></div>

    <div class="content-wrapper" style="padding-bottom: 0;">
        <h3>Cybersecurity Fundamentals</h3>

        <p>From the basics of Linux to the nitty gritty of networking, we'll teach you everything you need to know to get started in Cybersecurity.</p>

        <p>We know how daunting it can be to start off in such a complicated field - that's why this year we're releasing a series of Fundamental Skills mini-lectures that you can optionally use to consolidate your knowledge before coming to a session, or just to learn a new skill.</p>

        <h3>Cybersecurity Tools</h3>
        
        <p>We'll take you through how to use some of the most common tools in Cybersecurity - <a href="https://nmap.org/" target="_blank">nmap</a>, <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/" target="_blank">Wireshark</a>, <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp" target="_blank">Burp Suite</a>, and more!</p>

        <p>We'll also teach you how to build your own tools, using common languages like Python for automating tasks, enumerating websites and networks, and even cracking passwords.</p>

        <h3>Ethical Hacking</h3>

        <p>Perhaps the most exciting and varied area of Cybersecurity, ethical hacking (or penetration testing) is a challenging, fun and rewarding way to test your skills - and it can lead to a lucrative career!</p>

        <p>We'll teach you the tools and techniques you'll need, the theory behind what you're doing, and methodologies such as enumeration and privilege escalation.</p>

        <p>Then we'll provide a platform to practice your new skills with challenges, Capture the Flag events, and walkthroughs of boxes on platforms like Hack The Box, VulnHub, and TryHackMe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-wrapper" style="padding-bottom: 0;">
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>

        <p>As we come back to in-person events, we want to continue making our sessions as accessible as possible for all of our members.</p>

        <p>That's why we plan to continue recording and livestreaming our sessions on Blackboard Collaborate - this means if you can't make a session one week, or don't feel comfortable attending in person, you won't have to miss out.</p>

        <p>We're also going to make our sessions shorter after some feedback from last year, and will be providing a short break in the middle of sessions.</p>

        <p>Remember that you can <a href="/contact">contact our Inclusions Officer</a> Seb if you have any concerns about accessibility.</p>

        <h3>Balancing Theory & Practical</h3>

        <p>Our aim last year was to introduce more hands-on elements into our sessions in the form of worksheets. These were released weekly at the start of the year, but we struggled to create them for every session.</p>

        <p>This year, to make practical elements more consistent, we're going to split sessions roughly 50/50 in terms of theory and practical! We'll include worksheets or follow-along demos as part of every session, with a mix of easy and hard material.</p>

        <h3>Beginner Resources</h3>

        <p>As with last year, we'll begin the first semester by teaching the fundamental stages of a penetration test, and exploring common web application attacks and the basics of Command Line-based operating systems.</p>

        <p>This should give you a good baseline as we work up to a practice penetration test at the end of the semester!</p>

        <p>We're also going to release our Fundamental Skills series, which looks to create a list of key skills that everyone in Cyber should understand; we'll cover these in sessions too, but the series will take a deeper look at them so you can get ahead or have a recap.</p>

        <p>While we want to create resources for beginners, our returning members are just as important to us - we're going to mix up the practice platforms this year so you won't be repeating what you did last year, and introduce some cool new topics.</p>

        <h3>Events and Collaborations</h3>

        <p>We want to continue organising exciting guest talks, society collaborations, and CTF Events this year.</p>

        <p>Our BakeryTF event was one of the highlights of last academic year - we want to make a bigger and better CTF this time, and host it earlier in the year to avoid the busiest exam periods!</p>
