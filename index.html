        </div>
            <p>We deliver regular sessions covering a variety of cybersecurity topics - right from the theory, to applying it to ethical hacking!</p>
            <p>We formed in 2018, and for the 2020-21 academic year our committee hopes to continue improving our sessions and opening them up to more beginners in this challenging and exciting field!</p>
            <p>All of our committee have a keen interest Cybersecurity, and a wide range of experiences and knowledge that we're excited to share with you - from web design to hardware!</p>

    <div class="content-wrapper" style="padding-bottom: 0;">
        <h3>Cybersecurity Fundamentals</h3>
            <p>From the basics of Linux to the nitty gritty of networking, we'll teach you everything you need to know to get started in Cybersecurity</p>

            <p>We know how daunting it can be to start off in such a complicated field - that's why we'll also provide you with useful resources, such as cheatsheets and places to practice, available on our <a href="/wiki">wiki</a></p>

        <h3>Cybersecurity Tools</h3>

            <p>We'll take you through how to use some of the most common tools in Cybersecurity - <a href="https://nmap.org/" target="_blank">nmap</a>, <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/" target="_blank">Wireshark</a>, <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp" target="_blank">Burp Suite</a>, and more!</p>

            <p>We'll also teach you how to build your own tools, using common languages like Python for automating tasks, enumerating websites and networks, and even cracking passwords</p>

        <h3>Ethical Hacking</h3>

            <p>Perhaps the most exciting and varied area of Cybersecurity, ethical hacking (or penetration testing) is a challenging, fun and rewarding way to test your skills - and it can lead to a lucrative career!</p>

            <p>We'll teach you the tools and techniques you'll need, the theory behind what you're doing, and methodologies such as enumeration and privelege escalation</p>

            <p>Then we'll let you practice your new skills with challenges, Capture the Flag events, and walkthroughs of boxes on platforms like Hack The Box, VulnHub, and TryHackMe</p>

    <div class="content-wrapper">
        <h3>Engagement</h3>

            <p>We want to make our sessions less heavy on talking, and more interactive – that’s why this year we intend to include even more live demos, and provide worksheets to take home after sessions for extra practice</p>

            <p>We also want to make sure we improve the learning curve of our sessions, to appeal to members of all skill levels – we’ll be trying to make the basics even more interesting, while building up to some big challenges at the end of the semester! This way we hope to keep as many members engaged with the society as we can</p>

        <h3>Publicity</h3>

            <p>We also want to increase our presence on social media this year – we’ll be making regular posts on all our channels, and hopefully even releasing some blogs to help you dive deeper into the topics we cover in sessions!</p>

        <h3>Accessibility</h3>

            <p>As mentioned above, we want our early sessions to be more accessible to all of our members, and keep as many people engaged as possible. To support this, and improve learning for members who are new to Cybersecurity, we will be providing extra resources for our members. These will include worksheets, slides and useful links on our wiki, and blog posts to inspire further reading and deeper learning</p>

        <h3>Industry Links</h3>

            <p>Another one of the key things we’re trying to do this year is to reach out to Cybsersecurity companies (especially in and around Sheffield) for support and partnership.</p>

            <p>We want to form new links and make better use of existing ones to enrich the sessions we put on, and point our members to possible career paths – whether it’s via guest talks, careers events, or other exciting opportunities from our partners!</p>
