                <strong>We deliver regular sessions covering a variety of cybersecurity topics</strong>
                <p>We'll teach you all the theory, including <span class="blue">web application attacks</span> and <span class="blue">buffer overflows</span>.</p>
                <p>And we'll go from the theory to applying it to <span class="blue">ethical hacking!</span></p>
                <p>To teach you this we do <span class="pink">live demos, CTF challenges, theory lectures, worksheets</span> and more!</p>
                <p>We formed in 2018</p>
                <p>We're also always trying to expand our links with industry, and have some fun guest talks planned this year!</p>
