<p>While we strongly encourage participants in the society to <a href="https://su.sheffield.ac.uk/activities/view/ethical-student-hackers-society">buy a membership</a>, it's important that interested individuals have the opportunity to trial a session before joining. To that end, we offer one free session a year to non-members; simply email us at <a href="mailto:ethicalhackers@sheffield.ac.uk">ethicalhackers@sheffield.ac.uk</a> for a guest-link to the session.</p>

<p>Our regular sessions are hosted on Blackboard Collaborate, every Monday at 18:00 - 20:00 (ish). Members will be given access to our Blackboard Collaborate Organisation, from which they can view all sessions and recordings. Guests will receive a direct link to the session they have chosen!</p>
