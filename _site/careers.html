          <h3>Here you can find some useful information about careers in cybersecurity</h3>

<p>We know it can be daunting to start out in the cybersecurity world - that's why we've put together a list of resources for our members to use</p>

<p>On <a href="/careers/partners">this page</a> you can find lists of companies that offer graduate jobs, Year in Industry placements, and summer placement opportunities - in both the public and private sector</p>

<p>We'll also give some advice on what makes a good cybersecurity candidate, and how to improve your cyber CV!</p>

<p>Two of our committee members are currently on a Year in Industry, and one of us has already completed one - so we have plenty of advice to give, and are happy to answer questions during sessions or via any of our social media channels :)</p>

<h3>What kind of jobs can I get?</h3>

<p>There are cybersecurity jobs in a wide variety of fields - you can go into penetration testing, formal verification, network security, and academic research</p>

<p>You might develop software, give talks, defend a company's infrastructure, or perform live assessments of another company's applications or websites</p>

<p>There are also plenty of opportunities for those who wish to take a more academic path - Sheffield has both a <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/security">Security of Advanced Systems</a> and a <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/verification">Verification</a> research group</p>

<p>We have also curated a list of various <a href="/careers/partners">cybersecurity companies</a>, as well as some societies that we work with</p>

<h3>How should I practice?</h3>

<p>First and foremost, you should buy a membership and come along to our sessions! ;)</p>

<p>Once you've done that, there are plenty of useful resources on our wiki! We have curated lists of <a href="/wiki/resources">places to practice</a>, the skills and technologies you might want to learn, and have a whole host of learning resources - from <a href="/wiki/sessions">copies of our slides</a>, to assorted worksheets and mini tutorials</p>

<h3>Opportunities</h3>

<p>Many companies offer placements perfect for graduates or industry years - a good resource for finding placements is the University's <a href="https://careerconnect.sheffield.ac.uk/">Career Connect</a> portal</p>

<p>If Career Connect is not your thing, we will provide a list of opportunities advertised by companies that have partnered with SESH <a href="/careers/opportunities">here</a>. This list will be updated as our partners advertise opportunities, so remember to check back often! Some partners might choose not to advertise on our site, so make sure to come to all of our sessions to keep up with new placements and projects that are being offered!</p>

<p>There are also currently some opportunities for some small cybersecurity projects with one of our industry partners - if you are interested, please contact us at <a href="mailto:ethicalhackers@sheffield.ac.uk">ethicalhackers@sheffield.ac.uk</a></p>
