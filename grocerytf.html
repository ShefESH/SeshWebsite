    <div class="separator"><h2>CTF Description</h2></div>

    <div class="content-wrapper">
        <p>After a disaster last year, the SESH Bakery has improved their security practices (slightly) and made an ambitious expansion to a full blow grocery store - <span class="blue">frESH Groceries!</span></p>
        <p>However, they still have some leaks to plug! Their employees have bunked off the mandatory awareness training, and their web developers are still making sloppy mistakes (which will teach frESH not to use UoS Software Hut students for cheap labour...).</p>
        <p>Can you <span class="blue">help them identify the holes in their infrastructure</span> and various websites to prevent a full-blown cyber attack occurring again?</p>
        <p>There's also a <span class="pink">side quest</span>: the SESH committee has also made some improvements to their CTF infrastructure after their Raspberry Pi got stolen last year! Can you find your way into their CTF Management Panel again, and even discover some adjacent systems that they'd really rather not be found?</p>
